# openMHA is a software platform to process audio signals with hearing
# aid signal processing algorithms.  Signal processing algorithms are
# implemented as plug-ins that are loaded into the MHA process at
# runtime.
# 
# The openMHA framework itself and also the MHA plugins support
# configuration of their settings through a text-based configuration
# language.  This file is an example configuration that can be used to
# configure an MHA to perform signal processing with a non-adaptive
# differential microphone, followed by dynamic compression to compensate 
# for sensorineural hearing loss.

# Besides configuring the MHA, this file also has comments explaining
# every setting. We have left out some of the more advanced settings
# which have been left to their default value, because explaining all
# the possible options that are not actually used here might only
# distract from understanding this configuration.

# We have to tell the MHA how many audio channels to process.  Think
# of the number of audio channels as the number of microphones that
# your hearing support system uses to pick up sound.  If you wore a
# hearing aid device on each ear, and each hearing aid device had a
# signal microphone to pick up sound, then your number of audio input
# channels would be two.  If each of the hearing aid devices had not
# only one, but two microphones at slightly different positions, then
# you would configure the number of input audio channels to be
# four. This is what we do here with the "nchannels_in" setting.
# 
# This "nchannels_in" variable accepts values of type integer in the
# range 1 to INT_MAX.  This is sometimes denoted like this in MHA:
#
# int:[1,[
nchannels_in = 4

# Note that the corresponding "nchannels_out" variable is not
# writable, but is read-only.  We call read-only variable a "monitor
# variable", or shorter, a "monitor".  The number of output channels
# is auto-deduced by the MHA and can be read from the "nchannels_out"
# monitor.

# When we perform real-time signal processing, we process the signal
# in small chunks of data: Take a chunk from the sound card capture
# channels, process it, and output the result to the sound card output
# channels.
#
# MHA always operates like this, processing data in small chunks, even
# when the processed sound data comes from sound files.  The setting
# "fragsize" tells the MHA how many audio sample per channel are to be
# processed in each chunk.
#
# int:[1,[
fragsize = 64

# MHA processes discrete-time digital audio signals with a fixed
# sampling rate.  The sampling rate tells MHA how many samples per
# second have been digitized in each audio channel. Note that we use a
# floating point data type here, so you can use a non-integer sampling
# rate if you have to and your sound card supports it. The sampling
# rate 44100 that we use here is the standard sampling rate used on
# audio CDs and is supported by most sound cards.
#
# sampling rate in Hz
# float:]0,[
srate = 44100

# The MHA framework can load a single MHA plugin to process the data.
# We tell the MHA which plugin to load with the "mhalib" variable
# (historical reasons).  Note that the data type of the "mhalib"
# variable is string.
#
# When the assignment "mhalib = transducers" below is executed by the
# MHA, then the MHA framework will look for a dynamic library file in
# the file system with the name "transducers.so" (on linux, on windows
# the extension would be .dll, on mac it would be .dylib).  The path
# where MHA searches for this file is either the standard path for
# shared libraries on the system, or, if the environment variable
# "MHA_LIBRARY_PATH" is set, then MHA searches the directories listed
# in this environment variable.
#
# Usually MHA configurations consist of more than just one plugin.
# MHA provides structuring plugins that can themselves load other
# plugins for this purpose.
# 
# The transducers plugin that we load here can be used for calibration of
# input and output sounds, see below.
#
# MHA library name
# string
mhalib = transducers

# MHA supports different audio back-ends: Sound can come from and go
# to either
# - sound cards,
# - the Jack audio server,
# - sound files, or
# - the network.
#
# Users select the desired audio backend by loading the respective MHA
# IO library into the MHA process.  Similar to processing plugins, IO
# libraries are loaded as dynamic libraries into the process when the
# assignment to the "iolib" variable below is executed, and the same
# search path and file name extensions are used, as when processing
# plugins are loaded.  But because MHA IO libraries are the ultimate
# sources and sinks of sound in the MHA, they export a different
# interface to the MHA. Here we load the IO library that reads from
# and writes to sound files.
# 
# IO plugin library name
# string
iolib = MHAIOFile

# In the future you may have several MHA processes running on the same
# computer, performing different signal processing tasks.  You can use
# this MHA variable to describe what the purpose of this instance of
# the MHA is, so that you can tell to which MHA instance you are
# currently connected and not get confused.
#
# Name of this mha instance
# string
instance = allplugins

# parser "mha":
#
# Remember that above, we loaded the transducers plugin into the MHA
# with the assignment "mhalib = transducers".  When the MHA executed
# this assignment, it loaded the transducers plugin into the MHA
# process.  For historical reasons, MHA makes the configuration
# variables of this plugin available to the sub-"parser" "mha".  We
# call the hierarchy layers in the MHA configuration tree "parsers"
# because, besides providing hierarchy, they also perform the text
# parsing of the configuration commands.
#
# So in the following, we will see how some variables of the transducers
# plugin are getting set.

# The transducers plugin is responsible for the correct calibration of
# the sound in the MHA.  Remember that the MHA is a platform for
# hearing aid signal processing algorithms, and that hearing aids
# usually enhance the sound for hearing impaired listeners.  Hearing
# impairment generally means that people suffering from it have
# increased hearing thresholds, i.e. soft sounds that are audible for
# normal hearing listeners may be imperceptible for hearing impaired
# listeners.
#
# To provide accurate signal enhancement for hearing impaired people,
# algorithms have to be able to determine the absolute physical sound
# pressure level corresponding to a digital signal given to any MHA
# plugin for processing.  Inside the MHA, we achieve this with a
# convention.
#
# The convention that we use in the MHA is that the single-precision
# floating point time-domain sound signal samples, that we process
# inside the MHA plugins, have the physical unit Pascal (1 Pa = 1 N /
# m^2).  With this convention in place, all plugins can determine the
# absolute physical sound pressure level from the sound samples that
# they process.
# 
# However, when one just connects a microphone to a sound card and
# uses that sound card to feed sound samples to the MHA, these sound
# samples do not automatically follow the MHA level convention. The
# same is true when using sound files instead of sound cards for input
# and output.  Different microphones have different sensitivities.
# Sound cards have adjustable amplification settings.  Sound files may
# have been "normalized" before they have been saved to disk.  To be
# able to implement our level convention, we need to be able to adjust
# for arbitrary physical level to digital level mappings in the MHA.
# We do this with the transducers plugin, which is the only plugin
# that may not rely on this convention, because it is the one plugin
# that has to make sure that all other plugins may rely on this
# convention.  For this reason, it is usually loaded as the first plugin
# into the MHA using the "mhalib = transducers" assignment.
#
# transducers

# Remember that the configuration settings of the first plugin loaded
# into the MHA process, which here is the "transducers" plugin, can be
# accessed under the sub-parser named "mha". "transducers" has a
# configuration variable "plugin_name".  When a string is written to
# this configuration variable, then the transducers plugin will itself
# load another MHA plugin into the MHA process, which receives the
# calibrated input signal from transducers, and which sends its still
# calibrated output signal to the transducers plugin to adjust for the
# physical outputs.
#
# Here, transducers loads an mhachain, which is an MHA plugin that
# itself can load several other signal processing plugins and arrange
# them in a signal processing chain.
#
# Plugin name
# string
mha.plugin_name = mhachain

# After the above assignment is executed, the configuration settings
# of the mhachain plugins are accessible through the hierarchy
# "mha.mhachain", i.e. here, the individual plugin name gets reused as
# the hierarchy name.

# parser "mha.calib_in":
#
# calibration module
#
# The transducers plugin seperates input calibration settings and
# output calibration settings in two different sub-"parsers", named
# "calib_in" and "calib_out".
#
# To adjust the input signals to influences like microphone
# sensitivities, analogue amplifiers, and sound card A/D converter
# sensitivities, we write channel-specific "peak levels" into the
# transducers plugin's "calib_in.peaklevel" configuration variable,
# which is a vector of floats.  Each element specifies the "peak
# level" for the corresponding audio channel.  With peak level, we
# refer to the physical sound pressure level which would cause the
# sound card to transmit to the MHA a digitized signal with a digital
# level of 0 dB re full scale (dB FS).
#
# Of course, this is only a theoretical consideration:  A digital
# signal with 0 dB FS would be some rectangular waveform with maximum
# possible amplitude, and if you ever saw such a digital signal for real,
# the obvious suspicion would be that you were seeing was caused by
# massive clipping.
#
# Instead, we suggest that you produce a known sound level of static
# noise at the place of your microphones with the help of calibrated
# measurement equipment.  The calibrated measurement equipment should
# tell you the sound level in dB SPL Freefield with linear or Zero
# (Z-) frequency weighting. No A-, B-, C- or D- Weighting should be
# applied.
#
# This known sound level should be loud enough clearly to dominate
# other ambient noises (use a sound-proof booth for low ambient
# noises!), but still soft enough that no clipping occurs when the
# sound is digitized. Of course, all your equipment should behave as
# linear as possible.
# 
# Then, your peak level for each channel is the physical level that
# you measured minus the corresponding digital level in dB FS of the
# signal produced by your sound card.  (The digital level in dB FS is
# always negative, therefore, the peaklevel is always higher than the
# physical sound level that you have used for calibration.)
#
# Yes, calibration is complicated (and we are not even finished, yet,
# see next variable "fir").  But for hearing aid applications, it is
# crucial to get it right.
#
# The peaklevels given in the following assignment are just example
# values.  Note that a vector value is written with square brackets
# surrounding the element values, which are separated by spaces.

# Measuring and computing the correct peak level as above is not
# enough to calibrate a hearing aid system. Microphones (or any other
# component in your audio recording path) may have a non-flat
# frequency response, which has to be compensated for with a filter,
# before MHA plugins can actually rely on the level convention in the
# MHA. For this purpose, you can specify a matrix of FIR filter
# coefficients, with one filter per row. Rows are separated by
# semicola.
#
# If your microphones' frequency responses, you can either leave out
# the fir coefficients, or, as done here, provide FIR coefficients
# that do not actually alter the signal. These non-modifying FIR

# 'Hardware' softclipper
#
# When hearing aid algorithms apply gains to amplify sounds for the
# hearing impaired, the desired output signal may be louder than is
# physically possible to produce with the given equipment. If this
# situation is left unhandled, then the physical signal will be
# clipped by the sound card, producing very unpleasant sound
# artifacts.  It is always better to adapt and configure the hearing
# aid algorithms in such a way that output signal is never in danger
# of clipping.  Given the realities of such a flexible platform as the
# master hearing aid, where the hearing support algorithm can be
# connected to many different sound output transducers, we realize
# that this is not always possible. In order to lighten the burden of
# unpleasant clipping sound artifacts on the hearing impaired user
# testing a configuration, we have introduced a softclipper that will
# attenuate the overall signal with slower time constants when it is
# in danger of clipping. Note that this solution is still sub-optimal,
# because the prescribed output levels are not achieved, and because
# the softclipper may still produce unpleasant artifacts a little less
# harsh, but the solution is still better than hard clipping.
#
# The attack time constant, given in seconds, determines how quickly
# the softclipper can react to rising sound levels that are in danger
# of reaching hard clipping. Note that only a time constant of 0 can
# guarantee that no hard clipping occurs in the operating range of the
# softclipper.
#
# Note that the transducers plugin expects the values for these time

# overlapadd is one of the MHA plugins that perform conversion between

# perform its own spectral analysis. overlapadd performs both, the

# which analyses and modifies the signal while in the spectral domain.
# The plugin performs the standard process of collecting the input
# signal, windowing, zero-padding, fast fourier transform, inverse
# fast fourier transform, additional windowing, and overlap-add time
# signal output.
#
# The hop size, how much the analysis window is advanced from one
# processing invocation to the next, is not controlled by the
# overlapadd plugin itself, but is determined by the number of audio
# samples per channel and processing block.  In this example
# configuration, the hop size is determined by the "fragsize" setting
# of the MHA itself.  This setting can be found near the top of this

# dynamic compression
#
# Our standard dynamic compression algorithm measures the input sound
# level in each frequency band and looks up the gain to be applied in
# a gain table, and applies the gain to the signal in each respective
# band.

# Dynamic compression works by amplifying the signal with gains that
# depend on the level of the input signal itself.  Multi-band dynamic
# compression performs input signal level measurement in each
# frequency band to deduce the gain applicable to the respective
# frequency band.  Applicable gains would usually be higher for low
# input levels, and lower for high input levels, to compress the
# dynamimc range of the input signal into a smaller dynamic range at
# the output of the compressor.
#
# Because the applicable gain depends on the frequency band as well as
# on the input level, we use a 2-dimensional matrix to specify
# applicable gains. The gaintable matrix has one row of gains for each
# frequency band from the left audio channel, followed by one row of
# gains for each frequency band from the right audio channel.  The
# gains given are in dB.  Rows are enclosed by square brackets and
# separated by semicola.  The entire matrix is enclosed in an
# additional pair of square brackets.
#
# The first element in each row (i.e., taken together, the first
# column) specifies the gain in dB to be applied if the input level in
# the respective frequency band is equal to the value of the gtmin
# element given for that respective band (see gtmin description
# further below).
#
# The following elements in each row specify the gains in dB to be
# applied for other input values, where the input level difference
# between the individual elements in each row of the matrix is
# determined by the value of gtstep for the respective band (see
# gtstep description further below).
#
# This way, each row specifies the gains to be applied to the
# respective frequency bands for certain discrete input levels.  The
# actual input levels of the signal will regularly be different from
# any of these discrete input levels.  Therefore, the gain values in
# the rows are interpolated as well as extrapolated.
#
# The gain values that we use here in this example corrects the sound
# perception for a hearing impaired listener with a very uncommon
# mid-frequenc hearing loss.  Users of the openMHA may change the
# values given here using their own rationale to help hearing-impaired
# users.
#
# Note that we do not apply gains to the highest frequency bands here
# on both sides (9th and 18th row).  Having the highest frequency band
# here at all is just a trick to limit the extent of the
# second-highest frequency band, so that it does not extend up to the
# Nyquist frequency.
